          this is me typing with the new j-f format and without looking at my
          keyboard once. This is also my first time using css and have learned
          how to change the background, the font size and type, as well as the
          font color and line height. I have implemented several properties and
          values and have understood the box model that includes margins,
          borders and padding.
